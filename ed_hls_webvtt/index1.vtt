00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Balding and stooped with sideburns and a beak-like nose,
the old man, Proog, leads them off the bridge.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He pulls Emo through a slit in the wall.
They enter a dark, cavernous space filled with cables transmitting bolts of light.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
A suspended path of rectangular panels crosses the immense room.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
They run along the winding path.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
On the overhead wires,
small robotic birds take notice and begin to fly about.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000
One of the panels flips when Proog steps on it,
forcing him to run on the underside of the path!
Emo continues along the top with Proog defying gravity beneath him.
