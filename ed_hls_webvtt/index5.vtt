00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The doors slide shut, and Proog presses a red button.
The room lurches - they’re inside an elevator capsule!
A giant metal arm hurls the capsule up a massive shaft
past jagged steel doors that shut behind them like mechanical sphincters.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Up above, a robotic bird pecks at a scrap of metal.
The capsule whips by into the grip of another giant arm.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
They’re launched further up the shaft.
The capsule breaks apart leaving Proog and Emo on a fast-moving platform.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Proog watches the walls of the shaft whip by.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The platform rises into a concave land dotted with steel towers.
